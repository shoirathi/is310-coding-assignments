For this assignment I chose to scrape from the gravity falls fandom wiki. I chose this because it is one of my favorite shows of all time. Specifically, I chose the page which contains data about the first season. I did this because it contained important information about the episodes such as viewer rating. https://gravityfalls.fandom.com/wiki/Season_1. From this site I am scraping data about all the episodes from season one. The data points that I am scaping is episode number, episode title, and the viewer rating of that episode. I think this data is interesting and useful for researchers because they can see what episodes were rated the best for the season, and the ones that were rated lower. This information can be useful for the creators to know what worked in creating an episode and what didn't. This can help make content that is rated higher by viewers in the future.
