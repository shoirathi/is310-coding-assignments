This my website assessment 
The website I am inspecting is https://digital.la84.org/digital/
This website is using html and it also has the two components head and body.
I know this is using HTML because it says doctype html at the top when I inspect.
It aslso uses CSS which is spotted once I edited the color of the text on the webpage it showed the syntax of CSS which was a lot easier to understand, seen in images folder.
There are files that end with .js, .css, and .html.. There were also some image files that were .jpg files. A file that I didn't recognize was called bootstrap. When I did some more research on it I learned that it is a program or file that typically helps boot up or initialize a program. But it also contains js and css files in it. 
The developers of this website seem to be from the LA84 Foundation. This is because there are no authors or developers who are credited. There is no comments in the sources either that mention any developers. Although there are external sources and pictures that are credited for the information that was taken from them. I saw this when I went into the networks tab and found the urls of the assets that were used. The number of people who worked to build this website is undeterminable.
